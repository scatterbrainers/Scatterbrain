We are a team dedicated to writing and reviewing literature as well as our own experiences and life. Our blog is a place to share opinions and to write about matters openly and honestly. 
## Literary Guide
Book recommendations, reviews and critiques on classics, award-winners and popular reads. Literary analyses will be available too for more of a…philosophical…outlook.
## Experiences
The hustle and bustle of everyday life. The thrills of travel. Or maybe even the joys of a quiet moment alone. Here will be the ups and downs of adolescent life and the many thoughts shared along the way.
## Our Collection
Essays or pressing topics. Short stories and poems. Rants or commentaries. Surprise will be the only element. True to the scatterbrain nature.
## Francais
Ever the bilingual Canadian, from time to time we immerse in French culture and will include French posts as well to explore our growing language skills with our readers.
