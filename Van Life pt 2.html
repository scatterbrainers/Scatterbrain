            Hello! Since I've already recapped my time in Vancouver in my last post, today I'll write about my experience on Vancouver Island (week 2) and random stuff I did in 
            the metro (week 3)!

            It was my first time on the BC Ferry from Tsawwassen to Victoria and I'd expected to get seasick as I usually do, but I'm happy to report that there was minimal 
            turbulence :) We were also super lucky to sit by the windows and observe an orca whale come up for water; it was so cute and the kiddies were so excited!

            Victoria is so cute! It also has a bunch of niche touristy things like giant animal statues for people to take pictures with. Here's one from outside of our hotel:
