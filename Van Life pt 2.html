            Hello! Since I've already recapped my time in Vancouver in my last post, today I'll write about my experience on Vancouver Island (week 2) and random stuff I did in 
            the metro (week 3)!
        </p>
        <h2>1. Victoria</h2>
        <p>
            It was my first time on the BC Ferry from Tsawwassen to Victoria and I'd expected to get seasick as I usually do, but I'm happy to report that there was minimal 
            turbulence :) We were also super lucky to sit by the windows and observe an orca whale come up for water; it was so cute and the kiddies were so excited!
        </p>
        <p>
            Victoria is so cute! It also has a bunch of niche touristy things like giant animal statues for people to take pictures with. Here's one from outside of our hotel:
        </p>
        <img class = "image" src = "images\Van life pt 2\Bear statue.webp" alt = "Picture of a bear statue" height = 50% width = 50%/>
        <p>
            The next thing I noticed is the carriage culture! Especially near the dock, horse-drawn carriages are always available for a sightseeing ride. They literally gallop 
            on the streets with cars and stuff. Not just horses make up the tethered pullers of trolley carts, but also bikes and humans! It was 8 pm when my sister and I went 
            scavenging for food and lo and behold there was a line of trolleys down the street of men pulling trolley carts full of humans. I was quite surprised at their speed 
            but also like is it safe for them to run on the street?
        </p>
        <p>
            Random travel tips for next time:
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li>
                Book hotel early - we could have stayed at the Fairmont (seaside, mountain view, etc.) for the price of our little hotel but we procrastinated planning. Source: 
                sister
            </li>
            <li>
                Buy groceries/food before 5 pm! Everything closes early in Victoria. It's not like TO where you can get a late-night snack at 11pm. We struggled to find a 
                grocery store still open at 8!
            </li>
        </ul>
        <p>
            Another funny thing was the street music battles LOL like there would be a musician every 100 m down the street and all of their sounds would overlap. The bagpipe 
            players play from 11am to 6 pm ish non-stop and there are guitar singers everywhere and a Darth Vader who plays violin in front of the gift shops - just to name a 
            few. One time, the bag pipes had a match off with an Erhu across the street, aka they were trying to play over each other.
        </p>
        <p>
            Also there are just peacocks and deer that roam around the park fyi.
        </p>

            </tr>
        </table>
        <p>
            Then we went to look at tide pools at Holland Point! I didn't find any sea stars, apparently they were all wiped out due to a sea star disease 5 years ago TT. BUT! 
            there were still tons of sea anemones, keyholes, and hermit crabs. Also these paleontologic looking horseshoe crab things.

            OK that's about it lets get onto Nanaimo!
        </p>
        <h2>2. Nanaimo</h2>
        <p>
            I absolutely love Nanaimo. Reasons:
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li>
                It's beautiful: sea to sky horizons, mountain ranges, best seaside trails, public access fishing docs, sea lions everywhere, clear water with marine life
            </li>
            <li>
                People are SO HAPPY: festivals every other day - dancing, live music (the bands were so good I thought they were recordings), amazing parks, the International 
                Bathtub Racing Championships...
            </li>
        </ul>
        <p>
            I visited the trestle swimming spot under the highway on the way to Nanaimo and spotted a crayfish! Water is super shallow and clear but a little cold.
        </p>

            </tr>
        </table>
        <h2>2.1 Coombs</h2>
        <p>
            Just north of Nanaimo, there was a small town called Coombs... and there were goats that lived on the roof, farmers markets, and cozy bookstores.
        </p>
        <table class = "table">

        <h2>2.2 Oyster River Potholes</h2>
        <p>
            Just north of Coombs, there lied the Oyster potholes... and there was beautiful, crystal-clear water, paired with stunning rock formations dating back millions of 
            years.
        </p>
        <p>
            PS. the water was freezing cold!
