About Us: 

We are a team dedicated to writing and reviewing literature as well as our own experiences and life. Our blog is a place to share opinions and to write about matters openly and honestly.

Click on the link to access the website, and then explore! There are currently four different categories of writing to choose from (Literary Guides, Experiences, Our Collection, and Français), and all of them except for the Français one have at least one entry. Note that this project is still under construction, so it isn't the best it can be just yet.
