## Van Life pt 2
By Delight ☆ ～('▽^人)

Hello! Since I've already recapped my time in Vancouver in my last post, today I'll write about my experience on Vancouver Island (week 2) and random stuff I did in the metro (week 3)!

Victoria 

It was my first time on the BC Ferry from Tsawwassen to Victoria and I'd expected to get seasick as I usually do, but I'm happy to report that there was minimal turbulence :) We were also super lucky to sit by the windows and observe an orca whale come up for water; it was so cute and the kiddies were so excited!

Victoria is so cute! It also has a bunch of niche touristy things like giant animal statues for people to take pictures with. Here's one from outside of our hotel:

The next thing I noticed is the carriage culture! Especially near the dock, horse-drawn carriages are always available for a sightseeing ride. They literally gallop on the streets with cars and stuff. Not just horses make up the tethered pullers of trolley carts, but also bikes and humans! It was 8 pm when my sister and I went scavenging for food and lo and behold there was a line of trolleys down the street of men pulling trolley carts full of humans. I was quite surprised at their speed but also like is it safe for them to run on the street?

Random travel tips for next time:

Book hotel early - we could have stayed at the Fairmont (seaside, mountain view, etc.) for the price of our little hotel but we procrastinated planning. Source: sister

Buy groceries/food before 5 pm! Everything closes early in Victoria. It's not like TO where you can get a late-night snack at 11pm. We struggled to find a grocery store still open at 8!

Another funny thing was the street music battles LOL like there would be a musician every 100 m down the street and all of their sounds would overlap. The bagpipe players play from 11am to 6 pm ish non-stop and there are guitar singers everywhere and a Darth Vader who plays violin in front of the gift shops - just to name a few. One time, the bag pipes had a match off with an Erhu across the street, aka they were trying to play over each other.

Also there are just peacocks and deers that roam around the park fyi.

Then we went to look at tide pools at Holland Point! I didn't find any sea stars, apparently they were all wiped out due to a sea star disease 5 years ago TT. BUT! there were still tons of sea anemones, keyholes, and hermit crabs. Also these paleontologic looking horseshoe crab things.

OK that's about it lets get onto Nanaimo!

2. Nanaimo

I absolutely love Nanaimo. Reasons:

It's beautiful: sea to sky horizons, mountain ranges, best seaside trails, public access fishing docs, sea lions everywhere, clear water with marine life

People are SO HAPPY: festivals every other day - dancing, live music (the bands were so good I thought they were recordings), amazing parks, the International Bathtub Racing Championships...

I visited the trestle swimming spot under the highway on the way to Nanaimo and spotted a crayfish! Water is super shallow and clear but a little cold.

2.1 Coombs

Just north of Nanaimo, there was a small town called Coombs... and there were goats that lived on the roof, farmers markets, and cozy bookstores.

2.2 Oyster River Potholes

Just north of Coombs, there lied the Oyster potholes... and there was beautiful, crystal-clear water, paired with stunning rock formations dating back millions of years.

PS. the water was freezing cold!

Wise words overheard at Oyster River Potholes 07/27/24: 

"I'm gonna go on bake in the sun, Imma become a baked biscuit!" - an 8 y/o boy.
