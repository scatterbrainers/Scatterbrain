        <h1>Botanical Gardens, Toronto</h1>
        <p>
            For all the Toronto-goers—“Torontonians” does not and has never fit in my mouth—some of you will be outraged at such a suggestion: the Botanical Gardens, really? 
            It's been visited enough and is nothing new compared to the ROM's changing exhibits or the AGO's many paintings. Although the Toronto Botanical Gardens is not free 
            in terms of parking, it has always been a prime spot for me and my family to visit every summer. But, just like Niagara Falls, some of the original wonder has faded 
            from memory. It's reserved the same spot as all the commonplace items in my mind where it becomes safe to suddenly remember all the flaws present in my experiences 
            with it.
        </p>
        <p>
            It should also be noted that I have an everlasting phobia of bees and all flying insects, so maybe a flower garden wouldn't attract me too much...
        </p>
        <p>
            However, an urge to vent on this piece of childhood history is not what draws me to writing about the Botanical Gardens. It is the realization that I may have been 
            too harsh with it, too hasty in contemplating the serenity of the site, and I may have overlooked some of its grandest accomplishments.
        </p>
        <p>
            The Botanical Gardens is exactly what I described it as before: a flower garden, albeit, a wonderfully organized and selective flower garden. Upon entering, 
            immediately the sight is accosted by vividly colourful blooms and slightly roughened hedges. There is a particular hedge-like spiral path that attracts people's 
            attention and so, attracted mine. The spiral path slants upwards so that the center gives a view from a few meters aboveground and all throughout the climb, various 
            branches, stems and buds will graze your face and fingertips. It is a charming and even romantic scene, however, I found the touch of greenery to be slightly 
            discomfiting. I was forever expecting one of the fatter bumblebees to whiz past my ear and buzz in my face... which they did.
        </p>
        <p>
            Apart from the spiral path, there were pathways leading to various gardens, arranged with different flowers I do not know the names of, although my mother could 
            point some of them out. I confess, my descriptions of the foliage do not do the plant kingdom any justice, yet I trudge onwards in this review towards the prize. A 
            little ways to the right, I remember seeing a cafe I didn't bother ordering from and beyond that, a wide hill, much preferred by families. I did not visit the small 
            fountain or where I think should be a wishing well on my last visit, however I remember them quite fondly. A few days past, when I visited, I chose the path less 
            taken.
        </p>
        <p>
            We started following the trails down towards the stream. A stream or a brook, I don't quite know, just that it was pleasant and the sound of trickling was a nice 
            respite from the whoosh of cars on the street. I've had enough experience with running water smelling like what you'd imagine the city dump smells like. However, 
            this stream was fresh and I expected ducks to waddle around in places, but somehow they always like hanging around in smelly water more—something that continues to 
            baffle me. It was also raining that day—a drizzle, really—and instead of ruining the day, it rescued me from the oven-like conditions that summer always brings.
        </p>
        <p>
            We followed the trail for some way, over bridges or alongside them, but always near the stream which ran on for some distance. I had never followed the trail all the 
            way in, but I was surprised to see that the Gardens weren't just a collection of gardens, but also included a genuine forest. The trail winded its way deeper into 
            forestry and a network of streams that almost resembled arterioles in the way they branched out and flowed into one another. All around, the hilly terrain was 
            marvelous to look at: the dappled sunlight cutting through tree foliage; the shadows that amassed under the canopies; the rustling of leaves that betrayed an 
            animal's rapid movements. It was unlike other trails I'd walked and I'd equal it to the Rouge Valley trail that is unique during the fall.
        </p>
        <p>
            Of course, it was a bit unnerving to walk alongside forest like that. I wasn't afraid of being alone, rather I was afraid of not being alone. I didn't want to 
            encounter the bigger, more ferocious forest creatures. I believe Margaret Atwood, in an essay, once remarked on the nature of forests in human lore and 
            understanding. How they could be a source of malevolent imaginings and harbour insidious forces... or they could be a shelter for the wounded. A danger and a 
            disguise. Hansel and Gretel's undoing or Snow White's protection. Walking alongside the forest with only the occasional cyclers and wanderers left me on the edge of 
            these thoughts, on the edge of fear and curiosity. I didn't know whether to walk faster, towards human society, or to walk slower and enjoy the time away from it.
        </p>
        <p>
            I recommend this trail for anyone, it's simple to follow and only one of a handful of such trails in the Gardens. I would also advise anyone walking during a light 
            rain to not bring an umbrella, or not to use it much if you have one—the light sprinkling of rain doesn't bother much and feels perfect during August. I've seen many 
            walk trails in jeans, or worse, dresses, however if you want to truly relax, I would recommend wearing some loose pants and a T-shirt, with a cap in case of sunshine. 
            People also like to bring water along... but I don't find it necessary. It's just extra weight, and that is something you don't want on long walks like this. No 
            purses, no big, floppy hats, no snacks. Just bring your person and your phone if you need to. That’s all… just don’t go getting glued to that screen while you’re at 
            it.
