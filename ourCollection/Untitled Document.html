            There’s something inexplicably soothing about sitting at the edge of a windowsill, twenty-five storeys above the ground, towering over the rest of the city. It feels 
            as though you’re floating above the lights, as though you own them all and are simply taking a moment to sit and admire your possessions. It’s exhilarating. 
            Everything stands like ants below your feet, as though you could squash them all in a second. 
        </p>

            I’ve been reading a bunch of books on psychology, and I suppose that with my newfound knowledge, I can conclude that these thoughts are those of someone who longs 
            for power, someone who longs for control over their life and others. Someone who resembles the villains in just about every work of fiction ever written, although I 
            prefer to think it more resembles the anti-heroes. Or the tragic characters. I mean, it’s not too difficult to long for power in a city where you have none of it – 
            at the very bottom, the only way you can go is up. It’s not as though–
        </p>
        <p>
            My thoughts were interrupted by a glint in the distance, over a window a few storeys down. I stared at it for a few moments, before snapping myself out of the 
            awestruck gaze I had found on my face. I’ve been told multiple times that I get too easily distracted, and while I like to think of it as perceptiveness, it does get 
            me into trouble, at times. The fact that I had unconsciously scooted to the very edge of the windowsill was proof of that. Deciding I had spent long enough watching 
            over the city I longed for, I went to bed, eyeing the stars and the glint that seemed to accompany them.
        </p>

            The moment I woke up, I knew something was wrong. I could feel it, even before I had fully regained consciousness. If there’s one thing living in a city like mine 
            teaches you, it’s how to survive. And my survival instincts were telling me I was in danger. 
        </p>
        <p>
            Almost as though it had heard my thoughts, a voice hissed, <i>“Get the girl!”</i> Suddenly, there was an iron fist on my arm, and I was being pulled somewhere. My 
            eyelids wouldn’t open, and I couldn’t hear any voices, only scuffling. From the sounds of it, though, there were at least two people, but the same person was gripping 
            both of my arms…with a grip that was strong, but lacking technique. Realizing this, I lashed out, elbowing my assailant in the stomach and making an escape towards 
            what I assumed was the direction of my door. Looking back, though, that was probably not a very smart move, as just as I was sure I had escaped, I felt a small stab 
            at the back of my neck, and then there was nothing.
        </p>

            I awoke in a prison cell, this time fully aware of my surroundings. It was as though I had not slept, but I had no recollection of how I got to where I was. Slowly, 
            I tried to crack open my eyes, and I found I could do it perfectly fine. Whatever they had done to me, it had worn off of my eyes, bringing forth the question, <i>How 
            long had I been here for?</i> Determined to find out more about my situation, I opened my eyes fully and looked around.
        </p>

            Almost immediately, I heard a voice filtering through the bars of the cell I was in. I assessed the voice: it sounded as though it belonged to a woman, and by her 
            tone, it seemed she was rather important. It took me a moment to determine where she was–the bars hindered my vision, and it felt as though my eyes were stinging 
            whenever I tried to look at their steel surfaces, but when I finally caught a glance of the woman, my blood almost froze. I knew this person. Emphasis on the past 
            tense, though, because she didn’t seem to recognize me, simply staring through me as she spoke. The content of her words, however, were lost on me–I don’t know if it 
            was the stinging in my eyes from the bars, the recognition that I had of this woman, or both, but whatever it was, it stopped me from processing the woman’s words 
            properly. All I could think about was the fact that I knew the person standing in front of me, on the other side of the bars.

            I’ve learned that sometimes, you don’t want a memory, you just want the ghost of a memory. Just enough so that you can remember the emotions, but not enough to stop 
            the edges from blurring. Sometimes, it means you have to avoid something for months at a time, because otherwise, you will be forced to realize the ugly truth it is 
            enshrouded in. That’s how I feel when I remember the people from my old neighbourhood. And that’s how I felt when I was staring at the woman speaking to me through 
            the bars.
        </p>
        <p>
            “Are you listening?” The woman’s voice cut through my reverie, snapping me back to my surroundings and my situation. When I simply stared at the woman, startled, she 
            huffed.
        </p>
        <p>
            “Well, you better have been listening, because I’m not going to repeat what I just said.” And with that, she turned on her heel and left. I started panicking 
            slightly, wondering what she said and trying to gauge how important it could have been, but my efforts didn’t yield any results. Defeated,  I slumped onto the floor, 
            and tried not to fall into despair. Surely everything would be revealed soon.

            There are a surprisingly large number of forms of entertainment in a city where you are supposed to be working for 90% of your waking hours. I didn’t make that up – 
            it was from a study from a few years ago. I suppose this knowledge was the only thing keeping me sane in the small cell where my captors were keeping me. A drone 
            brought me food and water twice a day, but other than that, my captors seemed to have forgotten I existed, and there was nothing in the cell to keep me occupied. 
            Well, nothing that they had deliberately set up for my entertainment, although I had taken to scratching on the wall with my nails in an effort to do something. It 
            hadn’t been very effective, as the deepest scratches I made were barely noticeable, but it was better than nothing.
