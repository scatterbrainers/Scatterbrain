            The lights were nowhere near “off” in the city of Rycalis, despite the fact that it was a time when, in most other places around the world, most people would have 
            been sleeping. The lights in Rycalis were almost never off, a phenomenon that was catalyzed by the fact that the city kept the lights on in the government buildings 
            in the city overnight, as an added precaution to ward off potential troublemakers. As a side effect, most of the social gatherings in Rycalis took place at night, 
            leading to its reputation of being “the nocturnal city”. Neighbouring towns would wake up, and citizens would make sure to check the news for updates on Rycalis, 
            since if there were any, they almost certainly took place overnight.

            Even small children were accustomed to the nocturnal nature of the city, but for Lila, freshly twenty-two years old and attending her first business gathering, it 
            felt almost as though she were a stranger in her own city. This meeting was vastly different from the parties she had attended throughout her life–although the music 
            and lighting were similar, the topics of conversation were centered around work, profits, and networking. At least, that’s what was prevalent on Lila’s mind while 
            she roamed around the large banquet hall. At the back of her mind, she knew that these had always been the topics of conversation amongst the working adults in the 
            room, yet this was the first time she would be attending a party under such a title–in the past, she would always be “a child” or “a student”, and people treated her 
            as such, asking about her academic performance, or what hobbies she had. Now, however, she would no longer be asked about such things–rather, she would be expected 
            to converse about the corporate world. Especially at this gathering, which was purely held, by her workplace, for business purposes.
