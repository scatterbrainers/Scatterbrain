        <h1>Yelp! I’m drowning!</h1>
        <p>
            On Sam’s birthday, he went to the subway kabob stand and ordered 100 kabobs. The vendor was exhausted from making this order, fell sick and sneezed on a kabob. 
            Recoiling with disgust, Sam went onto Yelp and unleashed his rage. Words like “awful” and “unprofessional” were splattered, the business was destroyed. 
        </p>
        <p>
            Later, Sam went for a seaside walk and accidentally stepped on a kabob skewer. Impaled, he crashed into the water. 
        </p>
        <p>
            "Save me" he cried as he was swept away, "Yelp, I'm drowning." 
        </p>
        <p>
            It was no use, those kabobs made him a walking dumbbell. He was no match for gravity.
