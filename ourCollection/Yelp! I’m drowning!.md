## Yelp! I’m drowning!
On Sam’s birthday, he went to the subway kabob stand and ordered 100 kabobs. The vendor was exhausted from making this order, fell sick and sneezed on a kabob. Recoiling with disgust, Sam went onto Yelp and unleashed his rage. Words like “awful” and “unprofessional” were splattered, the business was destroyed. 

Later, Sam went for a seaside walk and accidentally stepped on a kabob skewer. Impaled, he crashed into the water. 

"Save me" he cried as he was swept away, "Yelp, I'm drowning." 

It was no use, those kabobs made him a walking dumbbell. He was no match for gravity.
